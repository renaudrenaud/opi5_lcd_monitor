Using a 5$ LCD to monitor your Orange Pi 5

## What is it?
LCD 1602 or 2004 are little screens using 16 characters on 2 lines or 20 on 4 lines. They are really cheap. This project use this little screens to provide some monitoring information for the Orange Pi 5 and other Single Board Computers (SBC).

The code is running inside a container. Yes, it's only few lines of code and you can consider it overkill, but isolation is the master key.

## I2C Protocol

I use the Debian CLI version from Orange Pi to run the Orange Pi 5 (OPi5)
